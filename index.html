        <div class="subheading mb-5"> Writing TutorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an aspiring librarian who currently works with college students to improve their writing as a tutor. My expertise is derived from an experience of growing up within local libraries, and improving myself with the services and necessities provided by a public safe haven. 
I pride myself on my ability to bridge gaps and create accessibility to knowledge and resources. I worked as a Supplemental Instruction Leader for a historically difficult class which built my skills to make this difficult material more accessible to a variety of learning styles. Working with groups of students, I used thoughtful redirection and questioning to encourage students to think deeper and form important study skills. I believe in enabling students to be independent so they donâ€™t become overly reliant on tutoring to be successful. It helps build confidence that is key to success of any kind, including education. I had an 86% success rate with my students, meaning that 86% received a B or higher in the course that I provided Supplemental Instruction.
<br><br>

        I later worked on a public humanities research project at UCR as a Project Lead, developing materials and guiding students in outreach and research, culminating in an ArcGIS Story Map I developed myself. I was able to successfully finish this project in under ten weeks, presenting it at an GIS meetup on campus, where I was able to demonstrate the potential of the software for humanities and community research. The local GIS librarian at UCR was impressed by the innovative ways I was able to adapt the project to the software. This project really motivated me because of how much I value the access created by the local humanities projects we documented. The biggest draw to a career in librarianship is the opportunity to work with a community to inspire knowledge and creativity.<br><br>

        As president of the English Majors Association at the UCR campus, I can help to inspire students and create access. I work with the English department in monthly meetings to provide a student voice in departmental concerns and advocate for student needs. I also work with our organization members to provide access to graduate application resources, upcoming course lists, and many other resources about opportunities and events on campus. I plan community events for students to engage in and find a place to belong on campus. When I first stepped into the role, we had a lack of lowerclassmen in our members, so I developed events and resources that would cater to them. Now we have a few dedicated first-year members who are inspired to serve the organization to a greater extent. I want to ensure the longevity of our organization, so working closely with the members to succeed in these roles in the future is my way of giving back to the student organization that inspired my educational and career goals. As I leader, I work to provide for our community in the present, but I also prepare for their future to the best of my ability.As a writing tutor at UCR, I work to develop core writing and grammar skills, but I also help to build self confidence. Most students didnâ€™t know where to start or relied on AI to complete their work, but I encouraged them to find value in their own voice and writing skills.
